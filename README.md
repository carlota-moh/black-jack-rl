# Black Jack Reinforcement Learning

In this project, we will be developing an agent that can play the Blackjack game using reinforcement learning techniques. We will be using the following [OpenAI Gym environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/blackjack/) to implement the game and test our agents.

Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by obtaining cards that sum to closer to 21 than the dealers cards (without going over 21). The game starts with the dealer having one face up and one face down card, while the player is dealt two cards facing up. The player can either "Hit" to receive another card or "Stand" (also known as "Stick") to keep their current hand value. The game ends when either the player or the dealer has a hand value greater than 21, or both have "stood" and their hands are compared.

We will be comparing the performance of multiple Reinforcement Learning techniques, including:
+ DQN:
+ Policies:

We will compare the performance of these algorithms by measuring the win rate achieved by each agent after a fixed number of episodes of training.

In conclusion, this project will provide a practical example of how reinforcement learning techniques can be used to train an agent to play a challenging game like Blackjack. By comparing the performance of different algorithms, we will gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each technique and their suitability for different types of problems.
